\section*{Experience}

  \companyrole{EXL Services (I) Private Limited}{Gurugram, India}{Senior Quantitative Risk Model Developer}{Dec 2021 - Present}

  - **Recovery Model Redevelopment:** Developed recovery model for a $3 billion LATAM-based mortgage portfolio by incorporating payment-based settlement logic to resolve underprediction from -45% to 8%.
  - **Climate Risk Stress Testing:** Enhanced new-booking sampling methodology in the Climate Risk Stress Testing framework for a $6 billion APAC mortgage portfolio, implementing a stratified sampling approach to maintain portfolio and geographical representativeness under constant balance sheet regulatory assumptions. 
  - **PD Model Benchmark Rate Transition:** Re-estimated logistic regression coefficients within a Markov Chain–based State Transition Matrix PD model following the benchmark rate change, preserving predictive performance (ROC 70.4%, Gini 41%) in line with MRM performance thresholds.
  - **Knowledge Development & Business Enablement:** Led business enablement for Climate Risk Stress Testing by developing 5+ case studies and training modules, upskilling 20+ analysts and supporting 3 client portfolio engagements.
  - **Team Leadership & Project Management:**  Supervised a six-member modeling team delivering 5+ projects under IFRS9, CECL, and CCAR; improved documentation turnaround by 30% and ensured 100% MRM compliance.
  - **Awards:** Received *ACE Award (2023)* and *Pioneer Award (2024)* for innovation and excellence in credit risk model development.

  \companyrole{Larsen \& Toubro Limited}{Chennai, India}{Data Scientist}{May 2019 - Dec 2021}

  - **Project Financial Risk Analytics Platform:** Designed GAM-based classification model to identify projects at risk of time overrun, achieving ROC of 80% and supporting early intervention and portfolio-level margin protection.
  - **Safety Risk Analytics Platform:** Collaborated with cross-functional teams to develop a Recency–Frequency–Severity–based Safety Scorecard model, quantifying project-level safety performance across 100+ sites and improving safety compliance by ~20%.
  - **Vendor Risk Intelligence Dashboard:** Built an end-to-end sentiment analysis model to process daily news for 1,000+ vendors supporting an order book of $72 billion, enabling business teams to identify and mitigate vendor-related operational risks.
  - **Analytics Adoption Initiatives:** Championed analytics adoption across multiple business units by demonstrating analytics-driven products, earning stakeholder trust, and establishing analytics as a core decision-support capability.
