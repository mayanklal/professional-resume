# Professional Resume (Quarto PDF)

This repository contains the source files for my latest resume, created using **Quarto** with a LaTeX-based template inspired by the works of **Sourabh Bajaj** and **Jake Gutierrez**.

The design emphasizes **ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compliance**, professional readability, and strong quantitative communication aligned with data science, risk analytics, and financial modeling domains.


## Objective

To maintain a high-quality, data-driven resume that is **machine-readable (ATS-compliant)**, **visually clean**, and reflects professional growth in **quantitative risk modeling** and **financial analytics**.


## Technology Stack

- **Quarto (QMD)** for document rendering  
- **LaTeX (via XeLaTeX engine)** for formatting and typography  
- **Custom `preamble.tex`** for style and layout refinements 


## Key Improvements (ATS Compliance and Readability)

The current version incorporates major structural and linguistic refinements to improve ATS parsing accuracy, recruiter readability, and overall resume impact.

| Category | Enhancement |
|-----------|--------------|
| Date Format | Unified date presentation (`MMM YYYY – MMM YYYY`) to ensure consistent parsing across ATS tools. |
| Buzzwords Removed | Eliminated vague terms and replaced them with measurable, performance-based phrasing. |
| Action Verbs Varied | Diversified verbs (e.g., Developed, Engineered, Led, Implemented, Enhanced) to improve engagement and avoid repetition penalties. |
| Quantified Impact | Added measurable outcomes (e.g., ROC 70.4%, Gini 41%, USD 10B+ portfolios, 100+ projects) to strengthen credibility. |
| Education Section | Added majors for each degree for clearer context and better ATS keyword capture. |
| Section Title Refinement | Changed `Certification` to `Certifications` to ensure proper ATS indexing. |
| Bullet Optimization | Condensed multiple bullets per project into focused, outcome-driven statements. |
| Formatting Cleanup | Removed bullets before company names and standardized section spacing for clarity. |
| Leadership and Strategy | Added dedicated leadership points under EXL and L&T to highlight team management, stakeholder engagement, and transformation initiatives. |
| Header Redesign | Center-aligned name and contact information for balanced layout and improved readability, following Jake Gutierrez’s template style. |
| Summary Section Added | Introduced a professional summary at the top to outline domain expertise, scale of work, and target roles. |
| Metadata Integration | Embedded relevant metadata and document properties for better PDF tagging and search recognition. |
